The Psychic Game
This game was built using JavaScript. The computer generates a random letter and  challegens the User to guess which letter was picked.
If the User guesses correctly, they are applauded for their psychic ability in the form of an alert. The player has 9 tries to guess the mystery letter and the score is tallied
each turn. The layout of the page was done using HTML, Bootsrap and CSS.

Can you guess the Mystery letter?
